# Description
This animated project was created primarily in JavaScript as part of my coursework for the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development program. It features an animated map that showcases the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. The tracker displays bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

# Installation/Usage
There are no specific installation steps. Just download the files, and have a blast! Feel free to use and edit as you see fit!

# Roadmap
I hope to add tracking capabilities beyond the MIT/Harvard area.
